#### 17.09.2020, Natural language processing in the corporate world

There are big opportunities for NLP applications in the corporate world. Still enormous amounts of time are spend trying to recall stuff, trying to classify information and looking for trade offs and sweet spots. Meaning and sense having been continuously being captured in words and data for centuries but here's clearly a tipping point. Computers are now able to transform raw text into some sort of sense, then store and retrieve that sense and assist us in taking decisions with it. doesn't mean a loss of autonomy, its just us climbing the ladder of abstraction and moving into a level that requires more creativity and less execution. More time contemplating and less time doing.
